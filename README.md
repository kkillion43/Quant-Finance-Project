# Quant-Finance-Project

__Data Scientist: Kyle Killion, Johnny Quick, and Chris Woodard__

Stock returns were collected and recorded utilizing the Python
Software PANDAS package and for forecasting we utilized R.  We predicted that our portfolio will have a
return rate greater than that of the S&P 500 (SPY).  Stock data was compiled utilizing the Yahoo
Finance Module.  We collected the Russell
1000 index list and built out the data frames to make the information
manageable and prime for selecting our portfolio.  Our data frames included:  Adjusted Close, Close, High, Low, Open,
Volume, LogVolume, Returns, Volatility. 
Returns were grouped by month and ticker next.  We next grouped by year and observed data
frames.  Portfolio selection consisted of
three (3) queries of our data frame.  We
created selections of stocks based on monthly, quarterly, and yearly results of
volatility statistics and pushed them into a dictionary.  We created CSV files in Python to leverage R
forecasting tools.  Our forecast tools
utilized were ARIMA, Holt Additive, Holt Additive Damped, and ETS.
